                    <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
                    <p>As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG under general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, I am not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.</p>
                    <p>Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, I will remove the content immediately.</p>
                    <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
                    <p>My website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.</p>
                    <p>A permanent content control of the linked pages is, however, not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, I will remove such links immediately.</p>
                    <h3>Copyright</h3>
                    <p>The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. The duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of utilization outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.</p>
                    <p>Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. If you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please notify me accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, I will remove such content immediately.</p>
