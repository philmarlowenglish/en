    <h1 id="blogpost">Hey Phil, why the hell is there a silent <i>b</i> in <i>debt</i>, who put it there, and what are we going to do about it?</h1>
    <p>Something that always jumps out at me when I'm listening to people speaking English is when someone decides to pronounce a letter that should be silent.</p>
    <p>So Phil, who on earth decided to add the silent <i>b</i> in <i>debt</i>?</p>
    <p>The people responsible for this absolute mess are medieval and renaissance scholars.</p>
    <p>A long time ago, English imported the word <i>dete</i> from Old French, which then lived quite happily in English for a while as <i>det</i>.</p>
    <p>Was this good enough for those medieval and renaissance scholars? You bet it wasn't! They believed that the English word should look more like its Latin equivalent — <i>debitum</i> — and decided to go and stick a <i>b</i> right in the middle, resulting in the new spelling of <i>debt</i>.</p>
    <p>But as we all know, humans generally don't like change, and people decided to continue pronouncing the word exactly as they had done before. To this day, nobody has ever tried to pronounce that b — that is, apart from people who see the word before they hear it, like kids and language learners.</p>
    <p>OK Phil, what are we going to do about it?</p>
    <p>Proudly force a <i>b</i> sound into the pronunciation — <i>"debbbt"</i>? 👊</p>
    <p>Rebel discretely and sneak in a very soft <i>b</i>? — <i>"de(b)t"?</i> 🤭</p>
    <p>Start a movement by writing the word without the <i>b</i>? — <i>"det"</i>? 🔨</p>
    <p>Or shall we do what most other people generally do — just accept the fact that <i>debt</i> rhymes with <i>get</i>, <i>let</i> and <i>set</i> and move on 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
    <p>What do you think?</p>
