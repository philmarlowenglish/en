    <h1 id="blogpost">Hey Phil, does <i>debt</i> really have a silent <i>b</i>?</h1>
    <p>Yes it does, and it sounds crazy to a native speaker when someone tries to pronounce that <i>b</i>!</p>
    <p><i>Debt</i> entered the English language through Old French, and was spelled for many years as <i>det</i>.</p>
    <p>Then, medieval scholars decided to add a <i>b</i> to make it look more like its Latin equivalent <i>debitum</i>, but people continued to pronounce it exactly as they had before. </p>
    <p>To this day, <b><i>debt</i> rhymes with words like <i>get</i>, <i>let</i> and <i>met</i></b>.</p>
    <p>Don't believe me? <a href=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/debt target="blank">Listen to the pronunciation on the Cambridge Dictionary website.</a></p>
  
What is “Indian English”?

Alongside Hindi, English is an official language of India. Although a small number of Indians consider English their first language, most speak another language at home, which influences the way they speak English.

In addition to Hindi and English, India has 22 other official languages (such as Bengali, Marathi, and Kannada). Hundreds of non-official languages are also spoken across the subcontinent.

For this reason, “Indian English” can sound quite different from the English spoken in the US or UK, especially to those who are unfamiliar with it.

What’s different about Indian English?

The influence of Indian languages can result in a completely different intonation, speed, and rhythm.

Listen for different sounds — a “w” can sometimes sound like a “v”, and “t” or “d” sounds may be softer.

You might occasionally hear grammar constructions in Indian English that differ from other varieties, depending on the speaker’s level of English proficiency. For example, some speakers might say “I am having a question” or “She is knowing the answer” (instead of “I have a question” or “She knows the answer”).

Regarding vocabulary, British English strongly influenced the way English is used in India, so Indians might use “flat” and “lift” rather than their American equivalents “apartment” and “elevator”.

New words have also been created, like “prepone” — meaning “to move something to an earlier time” — which was coined as the opposite of “postpone”, but isn’t commonly heard in British or American English — at least not yet.

Tone and formality

To many people who’ve worked with Indian colleagues or business partners, Indian English may often sound more formal than the business English you might be used to in other countries.

For example, an Indian colleague might write, “I am in receipt of your email” instead of “I got your email”.

This might seem unusual, but Indian English often leans towards formality in written and workplace communication due to historical and bureaucratic reasons — and this is simply a polite and respectful way of communicating at work 😊

So what's the best way to improve your understanding of Indian English?

Be open-minded and patient, and take every opportunity to communicate with as many Indians as you can.

Take an interest in the people and culture, and I’m sure the response you’ll get will be friendly and welcoming.

Bear in mind that it can be just as challenging for a speaker of Indian English to understand other varieties of English, including the way it’s spoken in countries like Germany, France, or Spain.

Overall, Indian English is a vibrant and distinct variety of English, and as with other forms of English, like Irish or Australian English, it can take some getting used to.
